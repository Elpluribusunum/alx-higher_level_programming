"""clears up the N-queens mystery.

finds all viable options for positioning N
NxN chessboard with N non-attacking queens

Example:
    $ ./101-nqueens.py N

N needs to be an integer that is at least as large as 4.

Attributes:
    board (list): The chessboard is represented by a list of lists.
    solutions (list): a collection of lists that include solutions

Solutions are represented in the format [[r, c], [r, c], [r, c], [r, c]]
where `r` and `c` represent the row and column, respectively, where a
queen must be placed on the chessboard.
